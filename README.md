# Pi Pod Shuffle

**Pi Pod Shuffle** is a screenless Raspberry Pi music player inspired by the iPod Shuffle.

It’s a simple brick with:
- USB-C power
- On/off switch
- No buttons
- No screen

It connects to Bluetooth headphones and immediately starts playing music.  
Playback, skipping, and volume are controlled entirely via your headphones.

## Smart Shuffle

Tracks how long you listen before skipping:
- **Instant skip** → wrong vibe, switch genres
- **Short listen** → close, adjust slightly
- **Long listen** → good match, play similar tracks

Songs are scored dynamically to match your current mood, producing a smart, adaptive shuffle instead of random playback.
